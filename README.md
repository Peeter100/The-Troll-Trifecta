![Thumbnail of The Troll Trifecta project](/../dev-datapack/lowres-alt.png)
The Troll Trifecta is a different take on the traditional _Unfair Minecraft_ formula. To make the map more unique, Peeter100 decides to travel between universes to recruit help from different franchises. Unfortunately, due to a small mistake, the plan fails and the universes collapse on each other, causing characters and mechanics from their respective games to get sucked into the map.
This map features characters and mechanics from a lot of different media, including:
- Sonic the Hedgehog
- Friday Night Funkin'
- Undertale
- Among Us
- Rick and Morty
- Five Nights at Freddy's
- Clash of Clans
and more!
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This map requires the use of **Java Edition 1.18.2** and has an estimated playtime of **5-8 hours**.
> It is recommended for singleplayer, but has full multiplayer support.
